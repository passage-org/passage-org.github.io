*Ensuring Completeness and Responsiveness of Public SPARQL Endpoints*

* About

{{{PASSAGE}}} constitutes an effort towards the adoption of SPARQL
query engines that provide complete and correct results! despite their
timeout threshold on query execution time that enforce fair use
policies…


** Try it live!

*** TODO unavailable for now: trial expired.

We pushed a live demonstration on [[https://live-demo-4455226726.europe-west2.run.app/][{{{GOOGLE}}} Google Cloud]].

#+BEGIN_right-comment
For the first run, the service might
take time to wake  up from idle mode;
so please be patient…
#+END_right-comment

It serves a [[https://dsg.uwaterloo.ca/watdiv/][WatDiv10M dataset]] ingested using the standard [[https://blazegraph.com/][Blazegraph]]
import procedure. We [[https://github.com/passage-org/passage-comunica][added an actor]] to the smart client [[https://comunica.dev/][Comunica]] that
divides query executions between the remote {{{PASSAGE}}} endpoint and
the local web client Comunica.

** How does it work?

On public SPARQL endpoints, a SPARQL query cannot run for more than a
predefined amount of time. When the query execution time reach this
threshold, the query execution is stopped. The results are partial and
a SPARQL continuation query is returned to provide the missing
results.

*** TODO provide a series of SPARQL execution as example.
*** TODO provide an environment to display SPARQL queries.



* Contribute

The code base is available on the [[https://github.com/orgs/passage-org/repositories][{{{GITHUB}}} GitHub platform]]. Feel
free to post issues, or to ask questions there. The reminder of this
section provides details about possible contributions that would be
greatly appreciated.

** Support for Backends

One major aspect of continuation queries concerns the support for
databases. With our first release, we focused on [[https://blazegraph.com/][Blazegraph]]. Despite
its terminated support, the *augmented* balanced trees representing the
triple/quad data store allows {{{PASSAGE}}} to efficiently skip large part
of triple/quad patterns, making simple subqueries with =OFFSET= clauses
executable.

#+BEGIN_SRC sparql :url https://query.wikidata.org/sparql :format text/csv :cache yes :exports code
  SELECT * WHERE {         # A SELECT query or sub-query
    BIND (rdf:type AS ?p)  # Var(s) assignment(s)
    ?s ?p ?o               # One triple/quad pattern only
  } OFFSET 18000000        # May need to skip a lot of elements
#+END_SRC

# The underlying indexes of Blazegraph allows getting the key at inde

On such a query, Blazegraph uses an index where =?p= is bounded first
=POS=. Thus, retrieving all =?o= and =?s= for such a =?p= remains
efficient. The results are produced in a deterministic order.  The
=OFFSET= states that the first 18000000 results should be
ignored. Instead of exploring these results then dropping them,
{{{PASSAGE}}} uses the index to retrieve the key at targeted offset,
and starts the range query there.
#+BEGIN_right-comment
The time complexity to create these iterators for range queries is
logarithmic compared to the number of elements matching the pattern.
#+END_right-comment

By using such sub-queries as basis, {{{PASSAGE}}} is able to pause and
resume the query execution of more complex SPARQL queries. 

#+BEGIN_SRC sparql :url https://query.wikidata.org/sparql :format text/csv :cache yes :exports code
SELECT ?wLabel ?pLabel
WHERE
{
  ?p wdt:P31 wd:Q98270496 . #meow? 
  ?p wdt:P1416 ?w .
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" . }
}
ORDER BY ASC(?wLabel) ASC(?pLabel)
LIMIT 10
#+END_SRC


*** TODO example of ~OFFSET~ query that runs well
*** TODO note on the not mandatoriness of this skip

** SPARQL Operators

For a start, we focused on a subset of SPARQL operators: core SPARQL
[[core-sparql][[3]]]. It comprises triple patterns, basic graph
patterns, joins, unions, filters, and optionals.

*** TODO a table of supported operators with associated passage's version

But the principle of continuation queries goes beyond these
operators. For instance, we already know that a subset of aggregation
queries allow continuation…

*** TODO example of a continuation query using aggregates.


** Smart Clients

{{{PASSAGE}}} solely relies on the SPARQL standard to pause and resume
a query execution until completion. When a SPARQL continuation query
is sent back by the SPARQL endpoint, the requester is in charge of
returning it back to the endpoint, to get complete results.

*** TODO example using ~curl~.

It remains tedious… Instead, we [[https://github.com/passage-org/passage-comunica][added an actor]] to the smart client
[[https://comunica.dev/][Comunica]]. With a few lines of code, this web client is able to
decompose the query to run locally the operators that the remote
endpoint cannot handle.

*** TODO example of decomposed plan.

Contributions in this area are twofolds:

+ Keep the smart client up-to-date with Comunica. /For instance, the
  current implementation sets the subset of operations handled by
  {{{PASSAGE}}}. Instead, the server should advertise it./


+ Implement the same logic in other smart client. /While Comunica
  provides a convenient browser experience, it lacks some
  multithreading capabilities. Other engines such as [[https://github.com/LiUSemWeb/HeFQUIN][HeFQUIN]] could
  fill this gap./
