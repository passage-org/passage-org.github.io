* PASSAGE

This project aims at deploying a front page for PASSAGE, where our
goals are clearly stated.

The website is static, we use [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]] to generate it. It is
complemented by css and javascript, when needed.

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Github action to deploy it automatically on push:

These pages are also meant to be the READMEs of their corresponding
GitHub project.
